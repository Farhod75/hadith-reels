## [2026-06-13] (cont.)

### Added
- **`split-narration.py`** — silence-aware narration splitter. Concats
  story+moral, then cuts into ordered <=28s chunks at natural pauses (ffmpeg
  silencedetect) so each fits fal Fabric's ~30s cap. Outputs
  out/talking/<base>-clipNN.mp3 + a ready generate/render block.
- **First real kids reel shipped:** kids-en-bukhari-6009 (girl lamb, thirsty-dog
  hadith), full chain: library → admin → split → Fabric → render-mascot-reel.
- **Hadith library:** added Sahih al-Bukhari 6009 (kindness to animals) in
  AR/EN/UZ/RU to hadith_library (TJ via RU fallback, P050).

## [2026-06-13] (continued)

### Added
- **Scene-baked mascots (Route A).** Mascots are now generated *inside* a
  scene via Nano Banana Pro using a locked mascot still as a face reference,
  so face/outfit stay consistent while the environment changes. Fabric then
  animates lamb + scene together. Assets: `assets/mascot/lamb-boy-mosque-night-v2.png`,
  `assets/mascot/lamb-girl-garden-day-v1.png`.
- **`render-mascot-reel.ps1`** — kids talking-mascot reel renderer. Talking
  clips (Fabric) are the spine; nasheed mixes under the voice at 0.20;
  optional burned subs (skipped uz/tj per P078); output
  `out/kids-{lang}-{slug}-mascot-reel.mp4`.

### Notes
- Route-A limitation: Fabric animates the whole frame, so anything directly
  above the head drifts with head motion. Mitigation: keep moon/large objects
  offset to a corner with empty headroom above the mascot. Route B
  (green-screen composite) deferred for fully-static backgrounds.

## [2026-06-13]

### Added
- **Talking-mascot kids lane (proof-of-concept proven).** New
  `generate-talking-clip.py` turns a mascot still + TTS audio into a
  lip-synced talking-mascot MP4 via fal **VEED Fabric 1.0**
  (`veed/fabric-1.0`; inputs `image_url` + `audio_url` + `resolution`;
  returns MP4 URL). Verified end-to-end at 480p:
  `assets/mascot/lamb-boy-v1.png` + `out/adults-en-bukhari-1520-moral.mp3`
  → `out/talking/test-boy.mp4`.
- **Two consistent lamb mascots** (Nano Banana Pro / Gemini): `lamb-boy-v1`
  (blue yakhtak + belbog + tyubeteika) and `lamb-girl-v1` (vibrant
  khan-atlas dress + braids), stored in tracked `assets/mascot/`.
  Generic animal mascots only — never sacred figures.
## [2026-06-11] — Animated reel pipeline + multi-platform launch

### Added (Pillar 2 — Animated reels)
- `render-reel.ps1` — automates Pillar 1 Steps 4–7 in one command; `-Scenes` mode stitches ordered animated clips with per-clip 1080×1920 @ 30fps normalization
- `generate-scene.ps1` — fal.ai Kling text-to-video AND image-to-video (animate your own photos to fix hands/Kaaba the model gets wrong)
- `generate-image.ps1` — fal.ai FLUX text-to-image (still frames for review before animating — image-first workflow)
- `animated-reel-scene-prompts.md` — scene-prompt design spec with religious guardrails ("themes not figures", MODE B = no faces, era→setting/dress map)

### Fixed
- P079 — admin story/moral/seerah now editable `<textarea>`s; fix translation errors before TTS (no regenerate cycle)
- P081 — Whisper `--max_line_width` orphaned-flag failure in render-reel.ps1
- P082 — mixed-framerate clips flashing by in animated stitch (now per-clip fps-normalized)
- Watch Reels tab — language-aware social links pointing to real `@SahihHadithReels` channels; replaced stale "coming soon" copy

### Published
- First animated reel: RU adults, Sahih al-Bukhari #1520 (women's Hajj as jihad), 4 scenes — live on Telegram + YouTube + Instagram + TikTok
- Brand identity set up on all 4 platforms (@SahihHadithReels, anonymous brand accounts)
