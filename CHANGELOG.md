## [2026-06-11] — Animated reel pipeline + multi-platform launch

### Added (Pillar 2 — Animated reels)
- `render-reel.ps1` — automates Pillar 1 Steps 4–7 in one command; `-Scenes` mode stitches ordered animated clips with per-clip 1080×1920 @ 30fps normalization
- `generate-scene.ps1` — fal.ai Kling text-to-video AND image-to-video (animate your own photos to fix hands/Kaaba the model gets wrong)
- `generate-image.ps1` — fal.ai FLUX text-to-image (still frames for review before animating — image-first workflow)
- `animated-reel-scene-prompts.md` — scene-prompt design spec with religious guardrails ("themes not figures", MODE B = no faces, era→setting/dress map)

### Fixed
- P079 — admin story/moral/seerah now editable `<textarea>`s; fix translation errors before TTS (no regenerate cycle)
- P081 — Whisper `--max_line_width` orphaned-flag failure in render-reel.ps1
- P082 — mixed-framerate clips flashing by in animated stitch (now per-clip fps-normalized)
- Watch Reels tab — language-aware social links pointing to real `@SahihHadithReels` channels; replaced stale "coming soon" copy

### Published
- First animated reel: RU adults, Sahih al-Bukhari #1520 (women's Hajj as jihad), 4 scenes — live on Telegram + YouTube + Instagram + TikTok
